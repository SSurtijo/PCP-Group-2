Intial setup =

1. Initializes a new Git repository in your current folder (Creates a hidden ".git" folder where Git will track all changes to your files).
# git init (Run this once when starting a new project to tell Git, "start tracking my code here.")

2. Adds all files in the folder to Git's "staging area (basket where you collect changes before saving them)".
# git add . ("." means add everything in this folder or filename for single file)

3. Saves (commits) all staged changes in Git, along with a message (-m) describing what you did.
# git commit -m "Initial setup commit with app.py"

4. Renames your current branch to main.
# git branch -M main

5. Connects your local Git repository to a remote repository on GitHub (called origin), the link is the URL to your GitHub project.
# git remote add origin https://github.com/SSurtijo/PCP-Group-2.git

6. Pushes (uploads) your commits from your local main branch to the main branch on GitHub.
# git push -u origin main ("-u" means set origin main as the default. Next time, you can just type git push) (Since you already ran "-u" origin main during setup, just typing "git push" will upload to GitHub) ("git push origin main" also work)

7. This creates a branch called "feature-name" from the current state of main, and you are now working on that new branch.
# git checkout -b feature-name ("checkout" Switch to a different branch, "-b" Create a new branch and immediately switch to it)

Tools =

Check Current Status (Shows which files are changed, staged, or need committing)
# git status

Pull Latest Changes (if collaborating)
# git pull (Updates your local copy with changes from GitHub)

Check your current branch
# git branch

Update =

#git commit	Saves your local changes as a commit (but not yet on GitHub)
#git fetch	Downloads new commits from GitHub (but doesn't apply them)
#git rebase origin/main	Re-applies your local commits on top of the new commits from GitHub
#git merge origin/main	Merges remote changes into your local history with a merge commit

Hard reset
#git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

# Step 1: You make changes locally
git add .
git commit -m "my local changes"

# Step 2: You get the latest changes from GitHub
git fetch origin

# Step 3: You apply their changes + yours cleanly
git rebase origin/main    # OR git merge origin/main

# Step 4: Push everything to GitHub
git push origin main
